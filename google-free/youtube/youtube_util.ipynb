They claimed to know this based off of a simple color identification test, where 20 respondents identified 330 colored chips by name. If a language had six words, they were always black, white, red, green, yellow, and blue. If it had four terms, they were always black, white, red, and then either green or yellow. If it had only three, they were always black, white, and red , and so on. The theory was revolutionary — and it shaped our understanding of how color terminologies emerge.\\n\\nRead more on the research mentioned in this video: \\n\\nCook, Kay, and Regier on the World Color Survey: goo.gl/MTUi9C\\nStephen C.

If the complaint goes through, whoever reported the idler gets a 25 percent cut of the fine, which can run anywhere from $300 to $2,000, for repeat offenders.\\n\\nGeorge Pakenham, a banker and clean air activist, knows that anti-idling laws have been on the books since the 1970s but were rarely enforced. He’s spent the last 10 years strolling through the city, asking drivers to turn off their engines. Now, with last year’s amendment to the law that lets anyone help to enforce it, he’s taken to the streets — and he’s making bank.\\n\\n“I’ve submitted 120 times and I got paid nine thousand dollars,” Pakenham said. “Cash in the bank.”\\n\\nHe’s been a one-man, anti-emissions cop since 2006, when he first asked a limousine driver to turn off their idling engine. He’s even made a documentary, “Idle Threat: A Man on Emission” which chronicled his efforts. And what began as one man’s quixotic mission to curb idling has gained steam: He’s got a dozen “street agents” who work with him on it now, and he hopes that with increased exposure — and the prospect of some decent cash rewards — that he’ll have hundreds of people working with him on it.\\n\\nOf course the extra cash is a nice perk for Pakenham, but it’s not the reason he got into it in the first place.\\n\\n“I was influenced by the aftermath of the Iraqi war,” Pakenham told VICE News. “It was quite clear that our motivation wasn't for weapons of mass destruction it was really for oil. And just at the same time my brother came down with stage four lung cancer and he was not a smoker. So I was looking for some sort of relief from that pain.”\\n\\nThere are also significant public health risks to air pollution from vehicle exhaust, which Pakenham and his “street agents” are acutely aware of. As newly initiated street agent and German pediatrician Patrick Schnell puts it, “air pollution significantly affects children … it doesn't only cause asthma, COPD and lung cancer but also causes heart attacks, strokes in adults.” And the climate impacts are significant, too. According to a 2009 Environmental Defense Fund study, idling vehicles in New York City release 130,000 tons of CO2 into the atmosphere each year.\\n\\nIf it were up to Pakenham and Schnell, thousands of cantankerous New Yorkers would be patrolling the streets, issuing tickets. But as Schnell puts it: “It’s not about writing tickets issuing tickets, having court it dates, no its about people stopping idling.”\\n\\nSubscribe to VICE News here: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE-News\\n\\nCheck out VICE News for more: http://vicenews.com\\n\\nFollow VICE News here:\\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/vicenews\\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/vicenews\\nTumblr: http://vicenews.tumblr.com/\\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/vicenews\\nMore videos from the VICE network: https://www.fb.com/vicevideo\", 'id': '_nRmU5Lytdc', 'url': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nRmU5Lytdc'}, {'title': 'Homer Simpson: An economic analysis', 'description': \"Mall santa, carny, and CEO: How Homer Simpson’s jobs represent America.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHere's the full article and list of jobs: http://www.vox.com/2016/9/6/12752476/the-simpsons-homer-middle-class\\n\\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\\n\\nVideo by\\nEstelle Caswell\\nZachary Crockett\\n\\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Our garden is fully infested with Redback spiders, these spiders are close cousins to Black Widow spiders. On Halloween this year I was not hunting down scary clowns, I was after lots of Redback Spiders. I made a special tool to help capture the spiders that are living in the garden. It proved to be very effective. To totally clear the area Mr Flamethrower is used, nothing survives the flamethrower. This is the second major spider infestation area in our backyard, The first was around the childrens Tonka toys. Little did I know there are many more to be cleared. The captured Redback Spiders are added to my killer spider home so all these female spiders will get to know each other really well. The one male Redback spider now has a huge number of females to please. If he doesn't he will just become their next meal. \\n\\nRedback Black Widow Spiders On Childrens Tonka Truck Toys Spider Infestation Scary Video\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsm26EaXrc0\\n\\nHorror Redback Spider Count On Kids Toys Giant Egg Sac Found\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gQGiunSFno\\n\\nThe Redback spider (Latrodectus hasseltii) is a species of venomous spider indigenous to Australia. It is a member of the cosmopolitan genus Latrodectus, the widow spiders. The adult female is easily recognised by her spherical black body with a prominent red stripe on the upper side of her abdomen and an hourglass-shaped red/orange streak on the underside. Females have a body length of about 10 millimetres (0.4 in), while the male is much smaller, being only 3–4 mm (0.12–0.16 in) long. Mainly nocturnal, the female Redback lives in an untidy web in a warm sheltered location, commonly near or inside human residences. It preys on insects, spiders and small vertebrates that become ensnared in its web. It kills its prey by injecting a complex venom through its two fangs when it bites, before wrapping them in silk and sucking out the liquefied insides. Male spiders and spiderlings often live on the periphery of the female spiders' web and steal leftovers. Other species of spider and parasitoid wasps prey on this species. The Redback is one of few arachnids which usually display sexual cannibalism while mating. The sperm is then stored in the spermathecae, organs of the female reproductive tract, and can be used up to two years later to fertilise several clutches of eggs. Each clutch averages 250 eggs and is housed in a round white silken egg sac. The Redback spider has a widespread distribution in Australia, and inadvertent introductions have led to established colonies in New Zealand, Japan, and in greenhouses in Belgium.\\nThe redback is one of the few spider species that can be seriously harmful to humans, and its preferred habitat has led it to being responsible for the large majority of serious spider bites in Australia. \\n\\nLeokimvideo is the home of the 'Big Spider Attacks' videos on youtube!

Its look is all part of a plan to create a more humane prison, one where the architecture isn’t part of the punishment. \\n\\nMost prisons around the world are consolidated into one single building. This style makes it easy and efficient for inmates to move around, but the design is monotonous and full of visually unappealing materials, like steel and concrete. Plus, tight quarters inside these spaces can foster conflict. \\n\\nHalden has a different structure: a campus design, where inmates move from one building to another, and are surrounded by lots of windows and construction materials that help muffle noise and take advantage of natural light.  \\n\\nThe prison’s layout also encourages guards to interact with inmates face-to-face, which fosters better relationships and reduces security-related incidents. \\n\\nHalden’s design style is expensive — which is why we mostly see it implemented in places with good social support systems, like Western Europe and Scandinavia. Still, the design is setting new standards for what prisons could be like in the future. \\n\\nBy Design is a new Vox video series about the intersection of design and technology, hosted by Christophe Haubursin. \\n\\nCheck out all the By Design episodes here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUMa0QkPzns&list=PLJ8cMiYb3G5eD0M1Bfm6lvHy5BR6hoY8X\\n\\nNote: The headline for this video has been updated since publishing.\\nPrevious headline: Norway is designing a more humane prison\\n\\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

They don't visit the doctor more than other developed countries:\\nhttp://international.commonwealthfund.org/stats/annual_physician_visits/\\n\\nBut the price we pay for that visit - for a procedure - it costs way more:\\nhttp://static1.squarespace.com/static/518a3cfee4b0a77d03a62c98/t/57d3ca9529687f1a257e9e26/1473497751062/2015+Comparative+Price+Report+09.09.16.pdf\\n\\nThe price you pay for the same procedure, at the same hospital, may vary enormously depending on what kind of health insurance you have in the US.\\n\\nThat's because of bargaining power. Government programs, like Medicare and Medicaid, can ask for a lower price from health service providers because they have the numbers: the hospital has to comply or else risk losing the business of millions of Americans.\\n\\nThere are dozens of private health insurance providers in the United States and they each need to bargain for prices with hospitals and doctors. The numbers of people private insurances represent are much less than the government programs. That means a higher price when you go to the doctor or fill a prescription.\\n\\nUninsured individuals have the least bargaining power. Without any insurance, you will pay the highest price.\\n\\nFor more health care policy content, check out The Impact, a podcast about the human consequences of policy-making.\\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-impact/id1294325824?mt=2\\n\\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

The impact was a climactic event that likely contributed to dinosaur extinction. Today, Earth remains vulnerable to asteroid collisions. In recent history, space rocks have landed in The United States, Russia, and elsewhere. In the event of a potential asteroid collision, NASA has developed several options for dealing with the threat. Researchers at NASA’s Center for Near Earth Object Studies and Jet Propulsion Laboratory have proposed using blunt force, weaponized deflection or a theoretical tool called a gravity tractor to deflect impact.

Since it wasn’t working properly, the ground maintenance crew just calculated the necessary amount of fuel on their own. \\n- Both the ground crew in Montreal and the flight crew had forgotten the fact that at the time, Canada was switching from the imperial system of measurement to metric. That's why all of Air Canada’s new planes were calibrated in metric units.\\n- The plane was at a height of 41,000 feet when the first warning light flared up. The crew figured that the fuel pump in the left wing had failed, so they switched it off. However, a few minutes later, the second light came on.\\n- The pilots desperately searched through the manuals to figure out how to deal with such an emergency. Unfortunately, there were no instructions on what to do if both engines are out. \\n- But the most serious problem was the loss of hydraulic pressure. A pilot’s ability to control the aircraft decreases along with a drop in hydraulic pressure. \\n- Maurice Quintal thought of the nearby Royal Canadian Air Force Base just 12 miles away in the town of Gimli. Even better, it was no longer in use! \\n- But the pilots still weren't aware of the most terrifying thing about this situation. That abandoned military base wasn’t just sitting there empty and derelict – it’d been converted into a motorsports park and racetrack!\\n- The people on the runaway didn't expect to see a gigantic plane approaching them at high speed. But hey saw it coming and got out of the way in time.   \\n- The whole incident was dubbed The Gimli Glider. And after receiving some heat from the airline for that initial fuel miscalculation, both pilots ended up receiving the Diploma for Outstanding Airmanship in 1985. \\n\\nSubscribe to Bright Side : https://goo.gl/rQTJZz\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nOur Social Media:\\n\\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/brightside/\\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/\\n\\n5-Minute Crafts Youtube: https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC\\n\\nPhotos: https://www.depositphotos.com\\nEast News\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nFor more videos and articles visit:\\nhttp://www.brightside.me/\", 'id': 'zGR0Dep0sqk', 'url': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGR0Dep0sqk'}, {'title': 'Malcolm Gladwell: The strange tale of the Norden bombsight', 'description': 'http://www.ted.com Master storyteller Malcolm Gladwell tells the tale of the Norden bombsight, a groundbreaking piece of World War II technology with a deeply unexpected result.\\r\\n\\r\\nTEDTalks is a daily video podcast of the best talks and performances from the TED Conference, where the world\\'s leading thinkers and doers give the talk of their lives in 18 minutes.

One byproduct is benzaldehyde, which gives off the scent of bitter almonds, as an additional signal that they’re secreting poison.\\n\\nThe millipedes don’t poison themselves, however. They’ve developed an immunity.\\n\\nThe cyanide can kill nearly any other animal trying to dine on the millipedes. Except one.\\n\\nNew research has found that one tough beetle is the only known predator in the world that can survive a direct blast of cyanide gas and keep going.\\n\\nBrandt Weary, an entomologist, studied these hardy beetles last year for his senior thesis at the University of California Berkeley. \\n\\nThe beetles, known as Promecognathus crassus, love to eat millipedes, even though they are only one-fifth the millipedes’ size.\\n\\nWeary wanted to know more about how the beetles withstood the millipedes’ tough chemical defense. He found that while many other beetles will avoid the cyanide-spraying millipedes, Promecognathus seeks them out.\\n\\n--- How many legs do millipedes have?\\n\\nMost millipedes have between 34-400 legs, and the record is 750!\\n\\n--- Why do these millipedes “glow” or fluoresce?\\n\\nOne theory behind millipede fluorescence is that it\\'s a warning sign. Moonlight has some UV light, so maybe an animal with better night vision can see the fluorescence even if we can\\'t. \\n\\n--- Which millipedes produce cyanide?\\n\\nOnly millipedes in the order Polydesmida produce cyanide. It\\'s the largest order of millipedes with about 3500 species. \\n\\n---+ Read the entire article on KQED Science:\\n\\nhttps://www.kqed.org/science/1939811/this-millipede-and-beetle-have-a-toxic-relationship\\n\\n---+ For more information:\\n\\nKip Will at UC Berkeley: https://ourenvironment.berkeley.edu/people/kipling-will\\nScience on the SPOT: Glowing Millipedes of Alcatraz: https://ww2.kqed.org/quest/2013/03/19/science-on-the-spot-the-glowing-millipedes-of-alcatraz/\\n\\n---+ Shoutout!\\n\\n🏆Congratulations 🏆to these fans for suggesting our *5 favorite common names*  for Xystocheir dissecta, on our Community Tab: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-3SbfTPJsL8fJAPKiVqBLg/community?lb=Ugwt2DsvG4dbBa5HPSF4AaABCQ\\n\\n#5 Unom Auhasard: Walking rave stick\\n#4 F E: \"Lumilipede\"\\n#3 Mr.salty: \" hell no\"\\n#2 Mystery Bomb Noel: \"blue galaxy\" \\n#1 Tinkili: \"Glowy Feets McGee\"\\n\\n---+ Thank you to our Top Patreon Supporters ($10+ per month)!\\n\\nBill Cass, Justin Bull, Daniel Weinstein, Chris B Emrick, Karen Reynolds, Jeremy Lambert, David Deshpande, Daisuke Goto, Bugeyed.fr, WhatzGames, Elizabeth Ann Ditz, Robert Warner, Shirley Washburn, Tatianna Bartlett, KW, Tanya Finch, Elizabeth Wolden, Sayantan Dasgupta, Monica Albe, Willy Nursalim, Jenn\\'s Bowtique, Jane Orbuch, Laurel Przybylski, Johnnyonnyful, Levi Cai, Jason Buberel, Mark Joshua Bernardo, Michael Mieczkowski, Jeanine Womble, Aurora Mitchell, Edwin Rivas, Marjorie D Miller, Companion Cube, Chris Murphy, Joao Ascensao, Two Box Fish, PM Daeley, TierZoo, Robert Amling, Shelley Pearson Cranshaw, Mario Rahmani \\n\\n---+ About KQED\\n\\nKQED, an NPR and PBS affiliate in San Francisco, CA, serves Northern California and beyond with a public-supported alternative to commercial TV, Radio and web media.\\n\\nFunding for Deep Look is provided in part by PBS Digital Studios.

Nirvana's Nevermind had just come out and the grunge movement had reached its peak in the realm of mainstream music. McCrea didn't resonate with this type of music at all. So lyrically and stylistically he sought to create the antithesis of mainstream rock music. From watching a few of his interviews we find out that he generally cares about the world. He stands against deforestation. He's a truth seeker, someone who questions what's happening in our society. He's also a person that likes to enjoy life for what it is. And these two facets of questioning the mainstream narrative and enjoying life can be traced throughout so many of his songs. Bringing attention to common sense and a life of well-being.\", 'id': 'b3jHvrt6gFI', 'url': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3jHvrt6gFI'}, {'title': 'The Fallen of World War II', 'description': 'An animated data-driven documentary about war and peace, The Fallen of World War II looks at the human cost of the second World War and sizes up the numbers to other wars in history, including trends in recent conflicts.\\n\\nPlease consider supporting this series by becoming a Patreon supporter: http://patreon.com/neilhalloran\\n\\n\\nWritten, directed, coded, narrated by http:///twitter.com/neilhalloran\\nSound and music by http://twitter.com/Dolhaz', 'id': 'DwKPFT-RioU', 'url': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwKPFT-RioU'}, {'title': 'The Vanishing of Flight 370', 'description': '[Credits, References, and More]\\nhttps://www.lemmi.no/p/the-vanishing-of-flight-370\\n\\nPatreon:  https://www.patreon.com/lemmino\\nSubreddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/lemmino\\nTwitter:  https://www.twitter.com/lemmin0', 'id': 'kd2KEHvK-q8', 'url': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kd2KEHvK-q8'}, {'title': 'Crazy Rescue Mission of Hijacked Airplane - Operation Entebbe', 'description': \"When an airbus was hijacked on July 4th 1976, Operation Entebbe was put into place resulting in one of the most stunning hostage rescue missions of all time.

My video editing skills are minimal and I am slow, so for better material please visit the channel of my nuclear companion Bionerd23:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/bionerd23\\n\\nThe RBMK is notable for its circular reactor lid where the control rod drive mechanisms reside and where loading and unloading of fuel occurs by means of a massive crane-mounted machine.  In essence, the hall is a heavy-walled hot cell designed to shield potentially high radiation levels while fuel operations are underway.  The hall also contains the short-term spent fuel storage basins, fresh fuel storage, a fuel transfer hatch to ground level, and access panels into the upper steamwater communication lines linking the reactor channels to the steam separators on either side.  Unit 2 at Chernobyl has been shut down since a fire in 1991 damaged its generators and feedwater system.  The reactor is defueled and dry, as are its spent fuel basins.\\n\\nSome highlights of this video tour:\\n0:31 The reactor building elevator threatens to malfunction and we take the stairs instead.\\n3:03 Entrance to the anteroom of the Central Hall on the +20.2m level, where we put on additional PPE clothing.\\n5:02 Central Hall shielding maze\\n7:20 Gamma radiation above pressure tubes on reactor face is about 3.3 mR/h.\\n10:10 Fuel element stringers in the spent fuel pool are locally contaminated and spicy, with one measurement showing 2 R/h.\\n14:16 Discussion of the division of reactor channels between fuel and the protection and control (SUZ) system, noting that one SUZ channel has been repurposed for neutron transmutation of silicon.  The RBMK was particularly good for this, and it occurred in Units 2 and 3 at Chernobyl. \\n14:58 Ascend the scaffolding to the refueling machine operator's compartment and look out the leaded glass window.\", 'id': 'Oe_zzTQFV3o', 'url': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oe_zzTQFV3o'}, {'title': 'Expert Jeweler Johnny Dang Shows Off His Insane Jewelry Inventory | GQ', 'description': 'Houston based celebrity jeweler Johnny Dang runs us through some of his best pieces, his process, how he invented grillz and why they call him the ‘King of Bling’.\\r\\n\\r\\nWarner Bros.

As a result, defendants languish in jail while waiting for court dates. \\n\\nWhile in jail, many of them lose their jobs, housing, and parental rights, all of which can weaken their community network, erode domestic relationships, and cost the government money to keep them in jail. \\n\\nDefenders of cash bail claim it is an effective mechanism for keeping violent criminals in jail. Despite their efforts to protect the status quo, several states have pursued bail reform. These states model their new systems on a pretrial risk assessment system. Risk assessments use algorithms to analyze data about a defendant and make recommendations for their pretrial release. \\n\\nThe District of Columbia has used risk assessments since the early 1990s with success. But many reform activists are concerned that when cash bail is replaced with risk assessments, courts are using another unjust — and potentially more biased — pretrial release mechanism. \\n\\nNote: The headline for this video has been updated since publishing.\\nPrevious headline: The case against cash bail\\n\\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

We can use the Schrödinger equation to solve for and evolve wave functions. Then we invoke wave-particle duality, in essence things we detect as particles can behave as waves when they aren\\'t interacting with anything. But when there is a measurement, the wave function collapses leaving us with a definite particle detection. If we repeat the experiment many times, we find the statistics of these results mirror the amplitude of the wave function squared. Hence the Born rule came into being, saying the wave function should be interpreted statistically, that our universe at the most fundamental scale is probabilistic rather than deterministic. This did not sit well with scientists like Einstein and Schrödinger who believed there must be more going on, perhaps \\'hidden variables\\'.\\n\\nIn the 1950\\'s Hugh Everett proposed the Many Worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. It is so logical in hindsight but with a bias towards the classical world, experiments and measurements to guide their thinking, it\\'s understandable why the founders of quantum theory didn\\'t come up with it. Rather than proposing different dynamics for measurement, Everett suggests that measurement is something that happens naturally in the course of quantum particles interacting with each other. The conclusion is inescapable. There is nothing special about measurement, it is just the observer becoming entangled with a wave function in a superposition. Since one observer can experience only their own branch, it appears as if the other possibilities have disappeared but in reality there is no reason why they could not still exist and just fail to interact with the other branches. This is caused by environmental decoherence.\\n\\nSchrodinger\\'s cat animation by Iván Tello\\nWave functions, double slit and entanglement animation by Jonny Hyman\\nFilming of opening sequence by Casey Rentz\\n\\nSpecial thanks to Mithuna Y, Raquel Nuno and Dianna Cowern for feedback on the script\\n\\nMusic from https://epidemicsound.com \"Experimental 1\" \"Serene Story 2\" \"Seaweed\" \"Colorful Animation 4\"', 'id': 'kTXTPe3wahc', 'url': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTXTPe3wahc'}, {'title': 'Americapox: The Missing Plague', 'description': \"Why didn't the Europeans get sick when they made contact with the American Indians?\\n\\nPart 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOmjnioNulo\\n\\nSpecial Thanks:\\n\\nBrian Mitchell, Danny Z, Joe Pantry, TheAlphaFactor, Duhilio Patiño, Benjamin Morrison, Jordan Melville, Mike Lanier, Martin, Steven Grimm, Alistair Forbes, Lou Rivellini, Tom Maher, Richard Jenkins, Chris Chapin, ChoiceMechanicalDenver.com, سليمان العقل, Andres Villacres, Phil Gardner, Nevin Spoljaric, Tony DiLascio, Robert Kunz, Tod Kurt, Daniel Slater, Sam Pitts, Thomas J Miller Jr MD, Markus Persson, Wenhao Nie, Today I Found Out, Patricio Fons, Mark Govea\", 'id': 'JEYh5WACqEk', 'url': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEYh5WACqEk'}, {'title': 'How We Domesticated Cats (Twice)', 'description': \"A 9,500 year old burial in Cyprus represents some of the oldest known evidence of human/cat companionships anywhere in the world.
