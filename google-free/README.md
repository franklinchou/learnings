# Google Free

Deciding to get rid of my Google account (for a host of
reasons including privacy and security).

Will switch to:

- Password manager (for those accounts that require Google login)
- Locally stored YouTube playlists backed up periodically

This will document what I did to migrate my life off the Google ecosystem.
